            This tool applies smooth volume fades to the beginning and/or end of your audio files. 
            You can enable fade-in, fade-out, or both, with adjustable durations from 0.5 seconds up 
            to 10 seconds (or half your audio length, whichever is shorter).
          </p>
          <p>
            Fade-in gradually increases volume from silence to full level. Fade-out does the reverse, 
            bringing audio smoothly to silence instead of an abrupt cut. The tool uses linear gain 
            ramps processed through your browser's Web Audio API.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Who needs audio fades</h2>
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li>
            Podcasters who want episodes to start and end smoothly instead of with 
            jarring cuts. They apply 2-second fades to every episode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meditation track creators who need gentle transitions. A 5-second fade-in 
            lets listeners settle in; a 10-second fade-out helps them ease out of the session.
          </li>
          <li>
            DJs mixing tracks together use fade-outs to blend songs smoothly. The 
            outgoing track fades as the incoming one fades in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Musicians recording live who want to eliminate the sound of fingers leaving 
            strings or breath after the last note. A short fade-out cleans up the ending.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ambient audio creators making background audio for videos need seamless 
            loops. Fades prevent audible clicks at loop points.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What to know before you use it</h2>
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li>
            Maximum fade duration is capped at 10 seconds or half your audio length. You can't fade 
             an entire 20-second clip, that would leave nothing unfaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            The fades are linear, not logarithmic. Linear fades sound natural for most purposes, but 
            some audio engineers prefer exponential curves for perceived smoothness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both fades process simultaneously. You can't apply fade-in now and fade-out later without 
            re-uploading the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            The output is MP3 format. If your source is lossless (WAV, FLAC), you'll lose that quality 
            in the output.
          </li>
          <li>
            Very short audio files might not support long fades. A 3-second file can't have a 5-second 
            fade-in.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <dd className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
              For podcasts and voice recordings, 1-2 seconds works well. Music often benefits from 
              3-5 seconds. Ambient or meditation tracks might use 10+ seconds.

            <dd className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
              Yes, toggle each fade independently. You can enable just fade-in, just fade-out, or both.

            <dd className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
              The fade calculation itself is lossless. However, output is encoded to MP3, which 
              introduces standard compression artifacts.

            <dd className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
              No—this tool uses linear fades. For exponential, logarithmic, or custom curves, you'd 
              need a DAW or audio editor.

            <dd className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
              Increase the duration. A 0.5-second fade might still sound sudden; try 2-3 seconds for 
              smoother transitions.

              No, this is a process-and-download tool. If you need to audition different fade settings, 
              use Audacity or similar software.
