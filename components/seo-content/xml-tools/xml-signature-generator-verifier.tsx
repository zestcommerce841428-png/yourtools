            This XML digital signature tool implements the W3C XML Signature standard to sign and verify XML documents.
            It uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure data integrity and authenticate the signer's identity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The signing process:
          </p>
          <ol className="text-muted-foreground space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside">
            <li><strong className="text-foreground">Generate key pair:</strong> A private key (for signing) and public key (for verification) are created using RSA or ECDSA.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-foreground">Create digest:</strong> The XML content is hashed using SHA-256 or similar algorithm to create a unique fingerprint.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-foreground">Sign the digest:</strong> The private key encrypts the digest, creating the digital signature.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-foreground">Embed signature:</strong> The signature is inserted into the XML as a <code>{'<Signature>'}</code> element with key info and algorithms used.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Verification reverses the process: the signature is decrypted with the public key, the content is re-hashed,
            and both hashes are compared. A match proves the document hasn't been altered and was signed by the key holder.

              question: "What's the difference between enveloped and enveloping signatures?",

            },
            {
              question: "Can I sign only part of an XML document?",
              answer: "Yes. Use XPath transforms to select specific elements for signing. This is common when multiple parties sign different sections."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I distribute the public key for verification?",
              answer: "Include it in the signature's KeyInfo element, distribute via certificate, or use a public key infrastructure (PKI) with trusted CAs."
            },
            {
              question: "What happens if the signed XML is modified?",
              answer: "Verification will fail. Even changing a single character alters the hash, causing the signature check to reject the document."
            },
            {
              question: "Can XML signatures be copied to fake documents?",
              answer: "No. The signature is computed from the document content. Copying a signature to different content fails verification because hashes won't match."
            },
            {
              question: "Do I need special libraries to verify signatures?",

            {
              question: "What's XML canonicalization and why is it needed?",
              answer: "Canonicalization normalizes XML (whitespace, attribute order, etc.) before signing. This ensures semantically identical XML produces the same signature."
