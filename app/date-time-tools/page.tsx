              What These Date & Time Tools Do
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              This is a collection of 18 free date and time tools that run entirely in your browser. No software installation, no subscriptions, no waiting. You pick dates or times, click a button, and get results instantly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              The tools cover four main workflows: calculating durations and differences (age, business days, time between dates), adding and subtracting time (days, hours, seconds), converting between formats (Unix timestamp, military time, seconds), and finding date information (day of week, week number, leap year, sunrise/sunset).
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
              How to Use These Tools
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Most tools follow the same pattern:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              <li>Select a date using the picker or enter manually</li>
              <li>Choose your calculation or conversion type</li>
              <li>Adjust settings like time format or exclusions</li>
              <li>View results and copy or download</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Everything happens client-side using JavaScript. Your data stays in your browser tab and never touches any server.
            </p>

              Limitations and Gotchas
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Time zones:</strong> Tools use your browser's local time zone by default. For UTC calculations, specify explicitly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Business days:</strong> Holiday calendars vary by country. Tools use a generic weekend exclusion — add your own holiday list for accuracy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Sunrise/sunset:</strong> Calculations are approximate and don't account for atmospheric conditions or elevation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              <strong>Unix timestamps:</strong> JavaScript uses milliseconds since epoch. Some systems use seconds. Tools handle both but verify your input format.
            </p>

              Why yourtools
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Date math is harder than it looks. How many days between March 15 and June 3? What date is 90 days from today? Is 2028 a leap year? You could open a calendar app, fire up a spreadsheet, or write a quick script. Or you could use these tools — focused utilities that do one calculation well without requiring software installation or exposing your data. Everything runs in your browser. No account, no sync, no upsells.
