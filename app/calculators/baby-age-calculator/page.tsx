              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Why Tracking Baby Age Matters</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                The first year of life is the most rapid period of development your child will ever experience. Tracking your baby's age accurately helps you monitor developmental milestones, schedule appropriate pediatric checkups, and understand what behaviors and skills to expect at each stage. Pediatricians use precise age tracking to assess whether your baby is meeting key developmental markers and to identify any potential concerns early.

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Age in Weeks vs Months During the First Year</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                In the early months, doctors often track age in weeks because development happens so quickly. A four-week-old baby is noticeably different from an eight-week-old. After about three months, the focus shifts to months because the pace of change, while still rapid, becomes slightly more predictable. By the time babies reach their first birthday, tracking by months becomes less critical for day-to-day development.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Corrected Age for Premature Babies</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Babies born before 37 weeks of gestation need special consideration when tracking age. Corrected age (also called adjusted age) accounts for the time the baby would have spent in the womb. This gives a more accurate picture of where the baby should be developmentally compared to full-term infants.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Why Doctors Track Differently</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Healthcare providers use different tracking methods based on the baby's age and health status. During well-baby visits, doctors may reference both chronological age (actual time since birth) and corrected age (for premature babies). This dual tracking ensures appropriate expectations for feeding, sleep, motor skills, and cognitive development.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Corrected age (or adjusted age) is your baby's age calculated from the due date rather than the actual birth date. It accounts for the weeks of pregnancy that were missed due to early birth. This adjustment helps parents and doctors set appropriate expectations for development.

                To find your premature baby's corrected age:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
                <li>Determine how many weeks early the baby was born (40 weeks minus gestational age at birth)</li>

              </ol>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
                Example: A baby born at 32 weeks (8 weeks early) who is now 16 weeks old chronologically would have a corrected age of 8 weeks.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">When to Use Corrected Age</h3>

                Use corrected age when assessing developmental milestones, introducing solid foods, evaluating growth charts, and discussing expectations with healthcare providers. Most doctors recommend using corrected age until at least 2 years old, though some children may benefit from adjustment until age 3.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">When Do Premature Babies "Catch Up"?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Many premature babies catch up to their full-term peers by age 2, though this varies significantly based on how early they were born and individual factors. Some children, especially those born very prematurely, may continue to show differences in development through school age. Regular monitoring with healthcare providers ensures appropriate support throughout childhood.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Count the number of full months from the birth date to today. If your baby was born on January 15th and today is March 20th, your baby is 2 months old. The calculator above does this automatically and also shows the remaining days beyond the full months.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Why track baby age in weeks?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                During the first three months, babies change dramatically week to week. Weekly tracking helps parents notice important developments in feeding, sleeping, alertness, and early motor skills. It also helps pediatricians identify any concerns during the critical early period.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">What is corrected age for premature babies?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Corrected age adjusts for premature birth by calculating age from the original due date rather than the actual birth date. This gives a more accurate picture of where a premature baby should be developmentally and helps set realistic expectations for milestones.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">When do babies reach milestones?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Milestone timing varies widely between babies. The ranges provided in medical guidelines represent when most babies achieve certain skills, but individual variation is normal. Some babies roll over at 3 months, others at 5 months. Both can be completely typical. Discuss any concerns with your pediatrician rather than comparing to other babies.

              <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Is my baby developing normally?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                This question worries every parent. Normal development covers a wide range. What matters most is steady progress over time, not hitting exact dates on a chart. Your pediatrician monitors development at regular checkups and can address specific concerns. Trust your instincts if something feels off, but also remember that babies develop at their own individual pace.
