              What These Binary Tools Do
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              This is a collection of 21 free binary tools that run entirely in your browser. No software installation, no server processing, no waiting. You enter numbers or upload files, click a button, and get results instantly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              The tools cover four main workflows: converting between number systems (binary, decimal, hex, octal), performing binary arithmetic and logic operations, manipulating binary strings (flipping bits, finding patterns, splitting/joining), and specialized applications (steganography, Gray code, UUID generation).
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
              How to Use These Tools
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Most tools follow the same pattern:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              <li>Enter your binary, decimal, hex, or octal number</li>
              <li>Select the operation or target format</li>
              <li>Click Convert, Calculate, or Process</li>
              <li>Copy the result or download as a file</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Everything happens client-side using JavaScript. Your data stays in your browser tab and never touches any server.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Binary to Decimal, Binary to Hexadecimal, Binary to Octal, and Binary to Text converters transform binary numbers into other representations. Decimal to Binary, Hexadecimal to Binary, Octal to Binary, and Text to Binary converters handle the reverse operations.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Binary Arithmetic</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Binary Calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on binary numbers. Binary Complement Calculator computes one's complement (bit inversion) and two's complement (for negative number representation).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Binary Manipulation</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Binary Bit Flipper/Manipulator lets you flip individual bits or apply bitwise operations. Binary String Splitter/Joiner breaks binary strings into chunks or combines them. Binary Pattern Generator/Finder creates or identifies repeating patterns. Binary Palindrome Checker tests if a binary number reads the same forwards and backwards.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Logic and Computation</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Binary Logic Gate Calculator simulates AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR gates with truth tables. Binary Checksum/Hash Generator calculates parity bits, CRC values, or cryptographic hashes for binary data.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Specialized Applications</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Binary Gray Code Converter transforms between binary and Gray code (where consecutive values differ by one bit). Binary Image Steganography hides secret messages in image files by manipulating least significant bits. Binary File Viewer/Editor displays binary files in hex format with ASCII preview. Binary Clock/Time Converter shows time in binary format. Binary UUID/GUID Generator creates universally unique identifiers.

              Limitations and Gotchas
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Number size:</strong> JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers. Very large integers may lose precision. Tools work best with numbers up to 2^53 - 1.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Two's complement:</strong> Negative numbers require a fixed bit width. Specify 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit representation as needed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>Gray code:</strong> Gray code is position-dependent. The same binary value maps to different Gray codes depending on bit width.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              <strong>Steganography:</strong> Hidden data is fragile. Image compression, resizing, or format conversion will destroy embedded messages.
            </p>

              Why yourtools
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Binary is the foundation of computing, but binary tools are scattered across calculator apps, programming languages, and expensive software suites. These tools exist because you shouldn't need a PhD in computer science to convert a hex color to binary, check if a number is a binary palindrome, or understand how two's complement works. Everything runs in your browser — focused utilities that do one thing well without installation or paywalls.
