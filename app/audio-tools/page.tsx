            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
              The tools run client-side using modern web APIs (WebCodecs, Web
              Audio) through the Mediabunny library. You load a file, choose an
              action, and the page decodes small chunks, applies the
              transformation, and re-encodes the result. For MP3 export, a tiny
              encoder module loads in the tab and is registered once per
              session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typical flow: pick a file, set options like bitrate, sample rate,
              trim points, or semitones, then process and download. Nothing is
              sent to a server.
            </p>

            <h2>Where these tools help</h2>
            <p>
              You want to cut two minutes from a lecture before sharing it with
              your class, but you do not want to install a DAW. Use the audio
              trimmer and export an MP3 in under a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are practicing a solo and need it slower but in the same key.
              The speed changer can time-stretch while preserving pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
              You recorded a podcast that peaks too high in a few spots. Run it
              through the loudness and gain analyzers, then normalize to a
              target level before publishing.
            </p>
            <p>
              A client sent an M4A but your editor wants WAV. Convert formats in
              the browser, no round-trips to a server.
            </p>
            <p>
              You need a quick waveform image for a thumbnail. Generate a PNG
              from the audio without opening design software.
            </p>

            <h2>What to know before using it</h2>
            <p>
              Processing time scales with file length and your device. Long
              uncompressed WAV files consume more memory than MP3 or Opus.
              Mobile Safari can reload tabs on very large jobs; a desktop
              browser is more forgiving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supported inputs cover common formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG/Opus,
              AAC/M4A). Some exports default to MP3 or WAV depending on the
              tool. Metadata editing works for common tags; embedded cover art
              support varies by format.
