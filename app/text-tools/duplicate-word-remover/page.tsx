    question: "How does duplicate word detection work?",
    answer:
      "The tool identifies repeated words and keeps only the first occurrence of each. You can enable case-sensitive matching to treat 'Word' and 'word' as different.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I output as a list?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Choose 'Comma-separated list' to get your deduplicated words as a list instead of a paragraph.",

    question: "Is my text data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All text processing happens in your browser using JavaScript. Your text never leaves your device.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it preserve punctuation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The tool can preserve punctuation marks. Words with different punctuation (like 'word' vs 'word,') are treated as different entries when punctuation preservation is enabled.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I remove duplicates from a keyword list?",
    answer:
      "Yes. This is a common use case. Paste your keyword list and the tool will remove duplicate keywords while preserving the order.",

  {
    question: "What's the difference between duplicate words and duplicate lines?",
    answer:
      "Duplicate word remover finds repeated words within text (like 'the the'). Duplicate line remover finds repeated entire lines in a list. Use the tool that matches your data format.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This tool scans your text word by word and tracks which words it has seen. When a duplicate is found, it's removed from the output.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tool maintains the original order of your text, keeping the first occurrence of each unique word. Options include case-sensitive matching and punctuation preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Output can be formatted as a paragraph, comma-separated list, or other formats depending on your needs.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Common Use Cases</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Keyword list cleanup:</strong> SEO professionals often end up with duplicate keywords when merging lists from multiple tools. Remove duplicates before importing to your SEO platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tag cloud generation:</strong> Create clean tag clouds by removing duplicate tags. Each topic should appear once, with size indicating frequency.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Social media bio optimization:</strong> Instagram and Twitter bios have character limits. Remove repeated words to maximize information density.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Writing cleanup:</strong> First drafts often contain repeated words and phrases. Use this tool to identify and remove unintentional repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hashtag deduplication:</strong> Remove duplicate hashtags from social media posts while keeping unique tags.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What to Know Before Using This Tool</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Word boundaries matter:</strong> The tool splits text on spaces and punctuation. "keyword" and "keywords" are different words.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Case sensitivity is optional:</strong> By default, "Word" and "word" are treated as the same. Enable case-sensitive matching if capitalization matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Order is preserved:</strong> The first occurrence of each word is kept. This maintains the original flow and emphasis of your text.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Not a grammar checker:</strong> Removing duplicate words doesn't guarantee grammatically correct output. Review the result before using.
