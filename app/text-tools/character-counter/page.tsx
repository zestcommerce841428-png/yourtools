    question: "Why do character limits matter for SEO?",
    answer:
      "Google displays about 60 characters for page titles and 160 characters for meta descriptions in search results. Staying within these limits ensures your full title and description show without truncation.",

    question: "Do emojis count as one character?",

    question: "How accurate are the platform limits shown?",

      "The limits displayed (Twitter 280, SMS 160, etc.) are the official limits as of 2024. Platforms occasionally update these, so always verify with the platform directly for critical use cases.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This character counter processes text in real-time as you type or paste. It counts every character including letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, and special characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tool displays two counts: characters with spaces and characters without spaces. Most platforms include spaces in their character limits, but some specific use cases (like certain programming contexts) may exclude them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Progress bars show how close you are to common platform limits. When you approach a limit, the counter provides visual feedback so you can adjust before hitting the ceiling.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Common Character Limits by Platform</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>SMS text messages:</strong> 160 characters per message. Longer texts get split into multiple messages, which may incur additional charges from carriers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Twitter/X posts:</strong> 280 characters for standard accounts. Premium accounts have higher limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Google search titles:</strong> About 60 characters display fully in search results. Longer titles get truncated with an ellipsis.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Meta descriptions:</strong> 155-160 characters display fully in Google search results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Instagram bio:</strong> 150 characters including spaces and emojis.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>LinkedIn headlines:</strong> 220 characters for profile headlines.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Who Uses This Character Counter</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>SEO specialists:</strong> Meta titles and descriptions need to fit within Google's display limits. This counter helps craft snippets that show completely in search results.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Social media managers:</strong> Every platform has different character limits. Writing posts that fit without truncation requires constant character counting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Developers:</strong> Database field limits, API payload constraints, and input validation often require exact character counts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Students:</strong> Some assignments specify character limits instead of word counts, especially for language learning exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Marketers:</strong> Email subject lines perform better under 60 characters. Ad copy for Google Ads has strict character limits per headline and description line.
            </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What to Know Before Using This Tool</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Spaces usually count:</strong> Most social media platforms and search engines count spaces toward character limits. The "without spaces" count is mainly useful for specific technical applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Emoji character counts vary:</strong> Emojis typically count as 2 characters due to UTF-8 encoding, but some platforms may display them differently. Test critical posts before publishing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Platform limits change:</strong> Twitter increased from 140 to 280 characters in 2017. Always verify current limits on the platform itself for important content.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Display width differs from character count:</strong> Google and other search engines may truncate titles based on pixel width, not just character count. Wide characters like "W" take more space than "i".
