    question: "What does the mirror text mode do?",
    answer:
      "Mirror text mode uses special Unicode characters that look like upside-down or flipped versions of regular letters. It creates text that appears upside down when viewed normally.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reverse each word individually?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The 'Reverse Each Word' option reverses the letters in each word while keeping the word order the same.",

    question: "Is this tool free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. This text reverser is completely free with no registration required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is reverse word order?",
    answer:
      "Reverse word order flips the sequence of words while keeping each word intact. 'Hello world' becomes 'world Hello'.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reverse text by lines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The 'Reverse by Line' option reverses the order of lines while keeping the content of each line unchanged.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does mirror text work everywhere?",
    answer:
      "Mirror text uses Unicode characters, so it works in most modern platforms including social media, messaging apps, and documents. Some older systems may not display it correctly.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This tool processes text entirely in your browser. Paste any text and choose from multiple reversal options.
            </p>
            <p>
              Character reversal flips every letter: "hello" becomes "olleh". Word order reversal keeps words intact but reverses their sequence: "hello world" becomes "world hello". Reverse each word flips letters within words but maintains word order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mirror text mode maps each character to its Unicode upside-down equivalent. Not all characters have mirror equivalents, so some may display differently or fall back to the original character.

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Social media posts:</strong> Create eye-catching upside-down text for Instagram captions, Twitter posts, or TikTok comments.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Puzzles and games:</strong> Encode messages for scavenger hunts, escape rooms, or puzzle games.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Programming tests:</strong> Test string manipulation functions and algorithms with reversed input.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Data validation:</strong> Verify that systems handle reversed or unexpected text input correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fun and pranks:</strong> Send messages that require effort to read, or create novelty content.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Palindrome checking:</strong> Reverse text to verify if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Reversal Types Explained</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Reverse Characters:</strong> Flips the entire string character by character. "Hello World" becomes "dlroW olleH".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reverse Word Order:</strong> Reverses the sequence of words. "Hello World" becomes "World Hello".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reverse Each Word:</strong> Flips letters within each word. "Hello World" becomes "olleH dlroW".
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reverse by Line:</strong> Reverses line order in multi-line text. Useful for reordering lists or code.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mirror Text:</strong> Uses Unicode characters to create upside-down text. "Hello" becomes "ʇxǝHⱯ".

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What to Know Before Using This Tool</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Mirror text uses Unicode:</strong> Upside-down characters are real Unicode characters, not images. They copy and paste like regular text.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Not all characters have mirrors:</strong> Some special characters and symbols don't have upside-down equivalents. These may display as the original character.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Screen readers may struggle:</strong> Mirror text can confuse assistive technologies. Don't use it for important content that needs to be accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Search engines see normal text:</strong> Reversed text is still readable by search engines. Don't use reversal to hide keywords.
