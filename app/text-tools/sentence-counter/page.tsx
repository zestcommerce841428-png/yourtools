    question: "Why is sentence count important?",

    question: "Does it handle ellipses correctly?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The tool recognizes ellipses (...) as continuation markers, not sentence endings. This prevents false sentence counts.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This tool uses punctuation-aware parsing to identify sentence boundaries. It processes text entirely in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              The counter looks for terminal punctuation (periods, question marks, exclamation points) but excludes false positives like abbreviations (Dr., Mr., etc.), decimal numbers (3.14), and ellipses (...).
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to sentence count, the tool calculates paragraphs, clauses, average sentence length, and provides readability metrics based on standard formulas.

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Students and academics:</strong> Many assignments specify sentence or paragraph requirements. Track your writing to meet guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Content writers:</strong> Shorter sentences improve readability. Monitor average sentence length to keep content accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Technical writers:</strong> Documentation standards often specify maximum sentence length for clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Editors:</strong> Identify overly long sentences that may confuse readers. Break up complex sentences for better flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Language learners:</strong> Practice writing complete sentences. Track progress in sentence construction skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Legal professionals:</strong> Legal writing often has strict formatting requirements including sentence structure guidelines.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Understanding Readability Metrics</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Average sentence length:</strong> Shorter sentences (15-20 words) are easier to read. Long sentences (30+ words) can confuse readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sentences per paragraph:</strong> Web content typically uses 2-4 sentences per paragraph. Academic writing may use longer paragraphs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Clause density:</strong> More clauses per sentence indicate complex sentence structure. High clause density can reduce readability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Readability scores:</strong> Formulas like Flesch-Kincaid use sentence length and syllable count to estimate reading grade level.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What to Know Before Using This Tool</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Abbreviations are handled:</strong> Common abbreviations like Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Jr., Sr., and Inc. are recognized and don't trigger sentence breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Edge cases exist:</strong> Unusual abbreviations or creative punctuation may not be recognized. Review the count for accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Quotations handled correctly:</strong> Sentences ending with quoted speech are counted properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Large documents work fine:</strong> The tool handles books and long documents, but very large texts may take a moment to process.
