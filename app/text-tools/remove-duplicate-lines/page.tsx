      "The tool compares each line and removes exact duplicates. You can enable case-sensitive matching to treat 'Hello' and 'hello' as different lines.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This tool processes text line by line in your browser. Each line is compared against all previously seen lines. When a duplicate is found, it's removed from the output.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tool maintains the original order of your list, keeping the first occurrence of each unique line. A counter shows exactly how many duplicates were removed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optional features include case-sensitive matching (treating "ABC" and "abc" as different), alphabetical sorting of the output, and removal of blank lines.

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Email list cleanup:</strong> Merge multiple subscriber lists and remove duplicate email addresses before importing to your email marketing platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Keyword research:</strong> Combine keyword suggestions from multiple tools and remove duplicates to build a master keyword list.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CSV data cleaning:</strong> Remove duplicate rows from exported data before analysis or import into a database.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Code refactoring:</strong> Clean up repeated import statements, CSS classes, or configuration entries.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Customer data deduplication:</strong> Merge customer lists from different sources and remove duplicate entries before CRM import.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">What to Know Before Using This Tool</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Exact matching only:</strong> The tool removes exact duplicates. Lines that differ by even a single character (including trailing spaces) are considered unique.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Case sensitivity matters:</strong> By default, "Hello" and "hello" are treated as duplicates. Enable case-sensitive matching if you need to preserve both.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Large lists work fine:</strong> The tool handles thousands of lines, but very large lists (10,000+) may take a moment to process.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Whitespace is significant:</strong> A line with trailing spaces is different from the same line without. Use the Whitespace Remover tool first if needed.
