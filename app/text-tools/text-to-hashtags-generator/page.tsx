      "The tool extracts key words and topics from your text and converts them into hashtags. It filters out common words and focuses on meaningful terms.",

    question: "Are the hashtags platform-specific?",

      "Yes. The tool organizes hashtags by platform (Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok) based on each platform's character limits and best practices.",

    question: "Is my data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All text processing happens in your browser using JavaScript. Your text never leaves your device.",

    answer:
      "Yes. You can copy hashtags with or without the # symbol depending on your needs.",

    question: "How many hashtags should I use?",
    answer:
      "Instagram allows up to 30 hashtags per post. Twitter works best with 1-3 hashtags. LinkedIn recommends 3-5. TikTok can use 3-5 or more depending on content.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use trending or niche hashtags?",
    answer:
      "Mix both. Trending hashtags increase visibility but have more competition. Niche hashtags have less competition and more engaged audiences.",

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              This tool analyzes your text to identify key topics, themes, and keywords. It then converts these into relevant hashtags.
            </p>
            <p>
              The generator filters out common stop words and focuses on meaningful terms that people actually search for. Hashtags are organized by platform and popularity tier.
            </p>
            <p>
              All processing happens in your browser. Your text and generated hashtags stay private.

          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>Instagram:</strong> Up to 30 hashtags allowed. Mix popular (1M+ posts), medium (100K-1M), and niche (under 100K) hashtags. Place in caption or first comment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Twitter/X:</strong> 1-3 hashtags perform best. Tweets with hashtags get more engagement but too many looks spammy. Keep them short and relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>LinkedIn:</strong> 3-5 hashtags recommended. Use industry-specific tags and follow relevant hashtag pages. Professional tone works best.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>TikTok:</strong> 3-5 hashtags typical. Mix trending sounds/challenges with niche content tags. Hashtag challenges drive discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Facebook:</strong> Limited hashtag use. 1-2 relevant hashtags can help but don't expect significant reach improvement.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Understanding Hashtag Tiers</h2>
          <div className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              <strong>High popularity (1M+ posts):</strong> Massive reach but high competition. Posts get buried quickly. Examples: #love, #instagood, #photooftheday.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Medium popularity (100K-1M posts):</strong> Good balance of reach and competition. Posts stay visible longer. Examples: #foodphotography, #travelblogger.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Niche hashtags (under 100K posts):</strong> Lower reach but highly engaged audiences. Posts stay visible for days. Examples: #veganmealprep, #sustainablefashion.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> Unique to your brand or campaign. Lower reach but builds community. Examples: #JustDoIt, #ShareACoke.
